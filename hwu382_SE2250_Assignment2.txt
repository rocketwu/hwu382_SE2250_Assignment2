Two way:
	1. create pickups in the hierarchy directly
	2. design it as a prefab and use script to create pickus automatically 

Choose 2
	Beacuse any change can be easily done by changing the prefab,and it is done automatically, you can change the number of pickups by simply change the loop.

ways to design pickups:

	1. design as static collider
		pickup has collider which IsTrigger is true but don't has rigidbody
	2. design as kinematic rigidbody collider 
		pickup has collider and rigidbody and both IsTrigger and IsKinematic are true
	3. design as rigidbody collider
		pickup has collider and rigidbody and only IsTrigger is true (and disable use gravity)

choose 2:

	First way is for the object whose transform is not change, but the pickup I design is rotating and waving up and down. so first way is not the option.
	Third way is for the object who needs be fully simulated by physics engine, but the pickup don't need to respond to the physics
	
	Second way is good because it blocks the physics engine which save the resources.
